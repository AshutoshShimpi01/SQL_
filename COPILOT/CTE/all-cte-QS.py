Got it. I'll provide 10 SQL questions at an **intermediate level**, focusing on the **Top N per Group** and essential multi-step aggregation patterns, mapped to your simplified schema. All solutions should be achieved using **CTEs (`WITH` clause)** for good practice.

Here are 10 intermediate SQL questions based on your schema:

## 10 Intermediate SQL Questions Using CTEs

### Top N Per Group Logic

1.  **Top 2 Highest Paid in Each Department:** Find the **Top 2 highest-paid employees** in every department. Display their name, salary, department name, and rank within the department. (Use `DENSE_RANK()`).
2.  **Top 3 Most Assigned Projects:** Find the **Top 3 projects** that have the highest total number of employees assigned to them across the company. List the project name and the total employee count.
3.  **Top 1 Least Active Department:** Identify the **single department** that has the lowest total number of employees. List the department name and the employee count. (Requires aggregation and a final rank/limit).
4.  **Top 2 Project-Heavy Employees:** In **each department**, find the **Top 2 employees** assigned to the most projects. List the employee name, department name, and their project count.

### Aggregation and Comparison Logic

5.  **Employees Above Department Average:** List the name and salary of every employee whose salary is **greater than the average salary of their respective department**.
6.  **Departments Beating Company Average:** Find all departments whose **average salary** is greater than the **overall average salary** of all employees in the company. List the department name and its average salary.
7.  **Projects with High Assignment Count:** Find all project names that have **more than 1 employee** assigned to them. List the project name and the count of assigned employees.

### Sequential Analysis and Missing Data

8.  **Project Start/End Comparison (Conceptual Lag):** Assuming the `projects` table has a `start_date`, list all projects where the start date is **later than the start date of the project immediately preceding it** (when ordered by `project_id`). Use the `LAG()` function.
9.  **Departments with Zero Projects:** Identify and list the names of all departments that currently have **zero employees assigned to any project**. (Requires careful use of joins and counting).
10. **Salary Jump Check (Conceptual Lead):** For each employee, show their salary and the salary of the employee who earns the salary **immediately higher** than them within the same department. Order by salary for the comparison. Use the `LEAD()` function.









I understand you want **10 intermediate to advanced SQL questions** based on the conceptual structure of your tables (`employees`, `departments`, etc.) but tailored to the logic of the problem you just solved (**Top N per Group using CTEs**), focusing on demonstrating strong knowledge of the `WITH` clause.

Since your actual tables don't contain `customers`, `regions`, or `orders`, I'll map those concepts to your existing schema:
* **Customer** $\rightarrow$ **Employee** (`employees`)
* **Region** $\rightarrow$ **Department** (`departments`)
* **Total Spending** $\rightarrow$ **Total Project Count/Project Duration** (`projects`, `employee_project_assignments`)

Here are 10 challenging CTE-based questions using your schema to practice "Top N per Group" and other advanced logic.

## 10 Advanced SQL Questions Using CTEs

### Top N Per Group Logic (Mapping to Customers/Region)

These questions use the same core logic as the "Top 3 Customers by Region" problem.

1.  **Top 2 Busiest Departments:** Find the **Top 2 Departments** with the highest total count of currently assigned projects. List the department name, total projects, and its rank.
2.  **Top 3 Project Leaders:** Identify the **Top 3 Employees** in *each Department* who are assigned to the most projects. List the employee name, department name, and their total project count.
3.  **Top 2 Most Expensive Projects (Conceptual):** Assuming the `projects` table had a `budget` column, find the **Top 2 Most Expensive Projects** in the company. List the project name, budget, and its rank.

### Advanced Lag/Lead/Comparison Logic (Using CTEs)

These questions use CTEs to simplify complex comparisons or sequential analysis.

4.  **Employees Beating the Group Average:** List all employees whose salary is **greater than their Department's average salary** *and* whose project count is **less than the average project count** for their Department. (Requires two separate aggregation steps, best done with two CTEs).
5.  **Departmental Salary Volatility:** Using a CTE to find the max and min salary per department, list every department that has a difference (max - min) in salary that is **greater than $10,000**.
6.  **Projects Lagging (Conceptual):** Assuming the `projects` table had an `estimated_duration_days` column, identify every project that has a duration **less than the duration of the *previous* project** (when projects are ordered by `project_id`). This requires a CTE for clean ordering and a `LAG` function.

***

### Multi-Step Aggregation and Filtering

These questions require multiple steps of aggregation and filtering, perfectly suited for chained CTEs.

7.  **Overworked Employees:** Identify employees who are assigned to **more projects than the average project count** of the entire company. List their name and project count.
8.  **Project Assignment Frequency:** Find the average number of projects an employee is assigned to *per department*. Then, list the names of all employees who are assigned **more than that departmental average**.
9.  **Departments with Diverse Projects:** Find all departments where the total number of unique projects assigned to its employees is **less than 3**. List the department name and the count of unique projects.

***

### Conditional Analysis

10. **The Unassigned:** List the `dept_name` for any department that currently has **no employees assigned to any projects at all**. (Requires a left join and filtering for nulls, potentially across three tables).
