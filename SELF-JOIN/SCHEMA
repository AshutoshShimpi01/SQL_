You need an SQL schema and a query to demonstrate a **self join**. A self join is used to join a table to itself, typically to compare values within the same table.

The most common real-world example is an **Employees** table where each employee has a manager, and the manager is also an employee listed in the same table.

Here is the SQL schema and the corresponding self-join query.

## SQL Schema: `Employees` Table

This schema establishes the relationship where the `ManagerID` refers back to the `EmployeeID` within the same table.

```sql
-- DDL to create the table
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Title VARCHAR(50),
    ManagerID INT  -- This foreign key references EmployeeID in the same table
);

-- DML to populate the table
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Title, ManagerID) VALUES
(101, 'Alice', 'Smith', 'CEO', NULL),  -- The CEO has no manager (NULL)
(102, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 'Sales Manager', 101),
(103, 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Sales Rep', 102),
(104, 'David', 'Lee', 'Sales Rep', 102),
(105, 'Eve', 'Wilson', 'HR Manager', 101);
```

## SQL Query: Self Join Operation

The self join requires you to use **aliases** (like `E` and `M`) to treat the single table as two separate entities in the query.

```sql
-- Query to perform a Self Join: Find every employee and their manager's name
SELECT
    E.FirstName AS EmployeeFirstName,
    E.LastName AS EmployeeLastName,
    E.Title AS EmployeeTitle,
    M.FirstName AS ManagerFirstName,
    M.LastName AS ManagerLastName
FROM
    Employees E  -- Alias 1: Represents the Employee
LEFT JOIN
    Employees M  -- Alias 2: Represents the Manager
    ON E.ManagerID = M.EmployeeID; -- The join condition links the employee's ManagerID to the manager's EmployeeID
```

### Explanation of the Join

1.  **Aliases (`E` and `M`):** We are querying the `Employees` table twice. The alias `E` refers to the table's role as the **Employee**, and the alias `M` refers to the table's role as the **Manager**.
2.  **Join Condition:** `ON E.ManagerID = M.EmployeeID` is the key. It links the `ManagerID` value in the Employee's row (`E`) to the corresponding `EmployeeID` in the Manager's row (`M`).
3.  **`LEFT JOIN`:** We use a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure that even the **CEO** (who has a `NULL` for `ManagerID`) is included in the result set, with their Manager fields showing `NULL`.
