Good question 👍 — let’s go step by step about **CTEs (Common Table Expressions) in SQL**.

---

## 🔹 What is a CTE?

A **Common Table Expression (CTE)** is a temporary result set that you define at the start of a query using `WITH ...`.
It acts like a "named subquery" that you can reuse later in your main query (or even in other CTEs defined after it).

---

## 🔹 General Syntax

```sql
WITH cte_name (optional_column_aliases) AS (
    SELECT ...
)
SELECT ...
FROM cte_name
```

---

## 🔹 Criteria / Key Rules of CTEs

1. **Placement**

   * Must be defined **at the beginning** of the query, before the main `SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE`.
   * Multiple CTEs can be defined, separated by commas.

   ```sql
   WITH cte1 AS (...),
        cte2 AS (...)
   SELECT ...
   FROM cte1
   JOIN cte2 ON ...
   ```

---

2. **Scope**

   * A CTE exists only for the duration of the query that follows it.
   * It is **not stored permanently** like a table or a view.

---

3. **Naming**

   * Each CTE must have a unique name in that query.
   * You can give column aliases inside the CTE or right after the CTE name.

---

4. **What can go inside a CTE?**

   * Any valid `SELECT` query.
   * Can contain `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY` (with restrictions), `UNION`, `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`.
   * Cannot contain things like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` directly.

---

5. **Column Aliases**

   * If the inner `SELECT` doesn’t return the right column names, you can rename them right after the CTE name.

   ```sql
   WITH sales_cte (region, total_sales) AS (
       SELECT region, SUM(amount) FROM orders GROUP BY region
   )
   SELECT * FROM sales_cte;
   ```

---

6. **Multiple CTEs**

   * You can chain CTEs.
   * Later CTEs can refer to earlier ones.

   ```sql
   WITH totals AS (
       SELECT emp_id, SUM(amount) AS total FROM sales GROUP BY emp_id
   ),
   avgs AS (
       SELECT AVG(total) AS avg_total FROM totals
   )
   SELECT * 
   FROM totals, avgs
   WHERE totals.total > avgs.avg_total;
   ```

---

7. **Recursive CTEs**

   * Special type of CTE that references itself (useful for hierarchies, tree traversal, sequences).
   * Structure:

     * **Anchor member** (base case).
     * **Recursive member** (references itself).
     * `UNION ALL` joins them.

   ```sql
   WITH RECURSIVE numbers AS (
       SELECT 1 AS n
       UNION ALL
       SELECT n+1 FROM numbers WHERE n < 10
   )
   SELECT * FROM numbers;
   ```

---

8. **Filtering inside CTE**

   * If you want CTE results to reflect only a time period (like 2024), the `WHERE` must be **inside the CTE**.
   * Otherwise, the averages/totals will include all data, and filtering later won’t work as expected.

---

9. **Performance Notes**

   * Some SQL engines **inline** the CTE (like a subquery).
   * Others **materialize** it (store temporarily).
   * This means performance can vary — but logically, results are the same.

---

✅ **Summary of CTE Criteria**

* Must start query with `WITH`.
* Must have a valid `SELECT`.
* Can define multiple CTEs.
* Exists only within the query scope.
* Can reference earlier CTEs, not later ones.
* Recursive CTEs must have an anchor + recursive part.
* Good for readability, reusability, breaking complex queries into steps.

👉 Since you’re practicing data engineering SQL: would you like me to also give you a **comparison of CTE vs Subquery vs Temp Table** (when to use each)?
